<p>In this video, we demonstrate the safe and proper use of the eDTP.</p>

<p>
Every aspect of the eDTP has been designed to the highest standards of comfort and safety. Our years of experience have helped us to create a Lift that is built purely with the end-user in mind.
</p>
<p>
Another feature pioneered by EDTP is the on-board diagnostic control panel which alerts you to any potential problems before they arise, (e.g. the lift has accidentally been switched off or incorrectly parked).
